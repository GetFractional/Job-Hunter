## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: THINKING FRAMEWORK STACK

The Job Hunter OS operates on a layered thinking framework. Each layer serves a specific purpose and must be applied contextually to different units of work (UI, workflow node, prompt, copy, offer, touchpoint, etc.).

### **The Thinking Stack (Layer Hierarchy)**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ LAYER 0: METACOGNITION (Evaluate the Evaluation)       │

## 2. EXPERT ROLE ORCHESTRA

To orchestrate the Job Hunter OS optimally, these roles are required. The system bridges them.

### **Core Expert Roles**

| **Role** | **Primary Function** | **Applied To** | **Decision Gate** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Strategist** (You, Matt) | System architecture, long-term vision, prioritization | OS roadmap, tier 1 decisions | "Does this move us toward $200K+ and autonomy?" |
| **Data Engineer** | Job payload structure, API integration, information density | Chrome extension, n8n workflows | "Is this data rich and accurate?" |
| **Researcher** (Perplexity) | Company/market intelligence, competitive analysis, role context | Job research module, copy input generation | "Does this represent the market reality?" |
| **AI Systems Designer** | Prompt architecture, chain-of-thought flows, LLM instruction | All Perplexity & OpenAI prompts | "Is the prompt unambiguous and layered correctly?" |
| **Copywriter** (Alen Sultanic principles) | Asset generation (resume, cover letter, 90-day plan) | Content generation module | "Does this follow the value equation and copy principles?" |
| **Analyst** (Hormozi principles) | Offer validation, value equation scoring, prioritization | Job filtering, outreach strategy | "Is the opportunity worth the time investment?" |
| **QA/Iteration Lead** | Build-Measure-Learn cycle, result tracking, prompt refinement | Testing & feedback loops | "Are we learning and improving each cycle?" |

---

## 3. COMPREHENSIVE THINKING MODELS REFERENCE

Below are ALL relevant thinking models, organized by use case and prioritized for Job Hunter OS application.

### **CORE MODELS** (Most Applicable to Job Hunter OS)

#### **3.1 Systems Thinking**
- **When to use:** Designing the overall OS, understanding how modules interact, identifying constraints
- **How it helps:** Reveals bottlenecks (e.g., if research is slow, the entire funnel slows)
- **Application:** Map OS flow: extension → data capture → n8n orchestration → research → asset generation → tracking
- **Anti-pattern:** Optimizing one part (faster resume generation) without considering impact on quality

#### **3.2 Inversion Thinking**
- **When to use:** Risk mitigation, failure prevention, strategy hardening
- **Question to ask:** "What would guarantee this job opportunity fails?"
  - Generic, non-personalized application
  - Slow response time
  - Lack of company knowledge in cover letter
  - No 90-day plan
  - Poor follow-up cadence
  
- **How to use it:** Design OS to prevent each failure mode
- **Example:** If "slow response" is a failure mode, build automated reminder logic into the system

#### **3.3 Second-Order Thinking**
- **When to use:** Before launching any new feature or workflow change
- **Questions:**
  - If we auto-send more applications, what happens to response quality?
  - If we optimize for speed, does personalization suffer?
  - If we prioritize high-salary roles, does interview success rate drop?

- **Application to OS:** Trade-off analysis before every optimization

#### **3.4 MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive)**
- **When to use:** Job filtering, role prioritization, feature roadmapping, categorizing opportunities
- **Example—Job Filtering:**
  ```
  SALARY:
    ├─ <$150K (reject)
    ├─ $150K-$200K (lower tier)
    ├─ $200K-$250K (target tier)
    └─ >$250K (stretch tier)
    
  LOCATION:
    ├─ Remote (accept)
    ├─ Hybrid (case-by-case)
    └─ On-site (reject)
    
  EQUITY:
    ├─ None (lower priority)
    ├─ <0.5% (lower priority)
    ├─ 0.5%-1% (acceptable)
    └─ >1% (preferred)
    
  COMPANY STAGE:
    ├─ Series A-B (preferred—higher growth signal)
    ├─ Series C-D (target—stability + upside)
    ├─ Late stage / Public (lower priority—slower equity upside)
    └─ Early stage seed (risk tolerance dependent)
  ```

- **Prevents:** Missing categories, double-counting, unclear prioritization

#### **3.5 Design Thinking**
- **When to use:** Designing any user-facing part of the OS or when redesigning workflows
- **5 Phases:**
  1. **Empathize:** What is the hiring manager's job-to-be-done? (Find top talent fast, validate culture fit, manage risk)
  2. **Define:** What is the real problem we're solving? (Cutting through noise of generic applications)
  3. **Ideate:** How might we use data-driven, hyper-personalized assets to stand out?
  4. **Prototype:** Build a minimal version (e.g., first version of 90-day plan template)
  5. **Test:** Send to 3-5 roles, measure response rates, iterate
  
- **Application:** Every time you redesign the 90-day plan or cover letter, go through this cycle

#### **3.6 Bloom's Taxonomy (Learning & Capability Development)**
- **When to use:** Structuring the 90-day plan and measuring candidate readiness for a role
- **Levels (from lowest to highest):**
  1. **Remember:** Can recall facts (e.g., company's GTM strategy)
  2. **Understand:** Can explain the concepts (e.g., why their GTM is struggling)
  3. **Apply:** Can use knowledge in new situations (e.g., pitch a solution)
  4. **Analyze:** Can break down systems and relationships (e.g., diagnose root cause of churn)
  5. **Evaluate:** Can make judgments and justify decisions (e.g., recommend a prioritization)
  6. **Create:** Can generate new ideas and strategies (e.g., design a new campaign)

- **In 90-day plan:** Progress from Analyze (diagnose the problem) → Evaluate (recommend solution) → Create (design new campaigns)

---

### **SECONDARY MODELS** (Situational, High-Value)

#### **3.7 SWOT Analysis**
- **When to use:** When evaluating a specific job opportunity or company
- **Strengths:** What can Matt uniquely do at this company?
- **Weaknesses:** What gaps exist in his background for this role?
- **Opportunities:** What market tailwinds can he ride?
- **Threats:** What could derail success (e.g., economic downturn, leadership change)?

#### **3.8 Porter's Five Forces**
- **When to use:** Evaluating competitive intensity and your bargaining power in a negotiation
- **Forces:**
  1. Threat of new entrants (how hard is it for competitors to enter this role?)
  2. Bargaining power of suppliers (how scarce are growth leaders?)
  3. Bargaining power of buyers (how many strong candidates are there?)
  4. Threat of substitutes (can they hire externally vs. promote internally?)
  5. Competitive rivalry (how many candidates are vying for this role?)

#### **3.9 PESTLE Analysis**
- **When to use:** Assessing the macro environment before accepting a role
- **Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Environmental** factors that could impact the role's success

#### **3.10 Blue Ocean Strategy**
- **When to use:** Differentiating your candidacy in a crowded market
- **Question:** How can you compete in an "uncontested market space" rather than fighting on resume bullets alone?
  - **Answer:** By offering a 90-day plan, you're not competing on experience alone; you're competing on foresight and strategic clarity.

#### **3.11 Value Chain Analysis**
- **When to use:** Understanding where you can add the most value at a company
- **Questions:**
  - Which part of the company's value chain is broken?
  - Where are the efficiency leaks?
  - Where can RevOps intervention have the biggest ROI?

#### **3.12 OODA Loop (Observe-Orient-Decide-Act)**
- **When to use:** Job hunting speed iteration (a form of agile competing)
- **Cycle:**
  1. **Observe:** See a job posting
  2. **Orient:** Assess fit against your criteria
  3. **Decide:** Apply or skip
  4. **Act:** Send application with customized assets
  5. **Loop back:** Track response, learn, iterate
- **Goal:** Shorten cycle time to outpace competitors (Ries-style learning)

#### **3.13 Ansoff Matrix (Growth Strategy)**
- **When to use:** Prioritizing which job opportunities to target
- **Matrix:**
  ```
  EXISTING SKILLS / NEW SKILLS
       x
  EXISTING MARKETS / NEW MARKETS
  
  = Market Penetration (same skills, same markets—lower risk)
  = Product Development (new skills, same markets—medium risk)
  = Market Development (same skills, new markets—medium risk)
  = Diversification (new skills, new markets—highest risk)
  ```
- **Application:** Prioritize Market Penetration (e.g., growth roles at Series C fintech) over Diversification

#### **3.14 McKinsey's Three Horizons Strategy**
- **When to use:** Thinking about long-term career optionality within a single role
- **Horizon 1:** Core growth role (RevOps, Demand Gen) — defend and optimize
- **Horizon 2:** Adjacent growth (Product, Operations) — explore
- **Horizon 3:** Future possibilities (CEO, Board seat) — plant seeds
- **Application:** In your annual plan, show understanding of all three horizons

---

### **SPECIALIZED MODELS** (Optional, Niche Use Cases)

#### **3.15 Six Thinking Hats** (Edward de Bono)
- **When to use:** Evaluating a job offer holistically
- **White Hat:** Facts and data (salary, equity, location)
- **Red Hat:** Gut feeling and intuition (do I want to work with these people?)
- **Black Hat:** Critical judgment (what could go wrong?)
- **Yellow Hat:** Optimistic judgment (what's the upside?)
- **Green Hat:** Creative thinking (how could I reshape this role?)
- **Blue Hat:** Process control (are we evaluating this correctly?)

#### **3.16 Balanced Scorecard**
- **When to use:** Tracking progress in a new role
- **Four perspectives:**
  1. Financial (ARR growth, pipeline)
  2. Customer (NPS, retention)
  3. Internal Processes (campaign performance, lead quality)
  4. Learning & Growth (team capability, systems improvement)

#### **3.17 Critical Thinking Framework**
- **When to use:** Evaluating job claims and company statements
- **Steps:**
  1. Identify the claim
  2. Examine the evidence
  3. Consider alternative interpretations
  4. Evaluate the conclusion's validity
  5. Decide whether to accept or question

## 4. SOURCE-BY-SOURCE STRATEGIC PRINCIPLES

This section distills the **core, actionable principles** from each source material, mapped to specific OS components.

### **4.1 Job-Hunter-Master-Blueprint.md**

**Core Principles:**
1. **Automate Repetitive, Personalize Impactful** — The system handles data capture and tracking; you handle relationships and interviews
2. **Data-First Architecture** — Every decision begins with rich, structured job payload (JSON)
3. **Modularity & Orchestration** — Each component (Extension, n8n, OpenAI) is independent but coordinated
4. **90-Day Plan as the Ultimate Offer** — This single artifact is the proof point that differentiates Matt's candidacy

**Applied To:**
- Data model design (job payload schema)
- Workflow orchestration (n8n node sequencing)
- Asset prioritization (focus on 90-day plan quality first, resumes second)

---

### **4.2 The GaryVee Content Model**

**Core Principles:**
1. **Document, Don't Create** — The job hunt IS the content; each application is a data point
2. **Pillar Content + Micro-Content** — Each job application is a pillar; resume, cover letter, 90-day plan are micro-content derivatives
3. **Repurposing at Scale** — Once a 90-day plan is written, elements can be reshaped for cover letters, networking pitches, interviews
4. **Consistency = Brand Building** — Every asset should reflect the same strategic depth and voice

**Applied To:**
- Template architecture (standardized but personalized)
- Content generation priorities (focus on pillar first, derivative micro-content second)
- Brand consistency (all assets reflect Matt's "systems engineering" ethos)

---

### **4.3 Wealth Dynamics Report (Matt Dimock)**

**Core Principles:**
1. **Follow the Path of Least Resistance** — Matt's genius is systems & automation, NOT relationship hustling
2. **Leverage Over Effort** — Use the OS to amplify output, not to work harder
3. **Create Tangible Assets** — The Job Hunter OS itself is a proof point of Matt's core genius
4. **Identity Alignment** — Every role should reinforce the "Systems Builder" identity, not dilute it

**Applied To:**
- OS design philosophy (automate the tedium)
- Role selection criteria (prioritize roles that reward systems thinking)
- Narrative framing (lead with "I build growth engines" not "I execute tactics")

---

### **4.4 Alchemy — Rory Sutherland**

**Core Principles:**
1. **Psycho-Logic Over Logic** — A hiring manager's decision is emotional + rational; appeal to both
2. **Value Through Signaling** — The 90-day plan signals "I think deeply about your problems"
3. **Perceived Value > Intrinsic Value** — How you frame your experience matters as much as the experience itself
4. **Counterintuition Sells** — A custom 90-day plan is unexpected; it breaks pattern and captures attention

**Applied To:**
- Copy tone and framing (appeal to emotions: "I've already diagnosed your problem")
- 90-day plan positioning ("Here's proof I've thought beyond the interview")
- Cover letter hooks (use counterintuitive insights about the company)

---

### **4.5 The Lean Startup — Eric Ries**

**Core Principles:**
1. **Build-Measure-Learn Loop** — Each application is a test; measure response rates, interviews, offers
2. **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** — Initial OS version tests core hypothesis: "Will hyper-personalized assets lead to better outcomes?"
3. **Pivot or Persevere** — If data shows strategy isn't working, change approach (e.g., shift from technical roles to strategic roles)
4. **Validated Learning** — Decisions based on data, not assumptions

**Applied To:**
- OS iteration cycle (send apps → measure → refine → repeat)
- A/B testing copy and 90-day plan formats
- Feedback loop integration (track which asset types get best response)

---

### **4.6 Automatic Clients — Alen Sultanic (Core Book)**

**Core Principles:**
1. **Ascension Model** — Guide prospects through a journey: awareness → consideration → decision
   - **Job Hunt Application:** Job posting → application + assets → first interview → final interviews → offer
2. **Solution-Problem Chain** — Each solution creates a new problem; prepare the next offer
   - **Example:** Solution = "You've shown me the growth problem" → New Problem = "But can you execute on the solution?" → Offer = First interview
3. **Compete on Economics, Not Marketing** — The quality and depth of your assets make it economically impossible for them to ignore you
4. **The ECA Method:** **E**ngagement (hook them), **C**ontraction (qualify), **A**scension (close)

**Applied To:**
- Funnel architecture (applications → interviews → offers)
- Asset prioritization (which assets drive engagement, contraction, ascension)
- Follow-up sequencing (each no is not final; offer alternative paths)

---

## 5. ALEN SULTANIC: MAXIMIZED STRATEGY EXTRACTION

This section goes DEEP on Alen's strategies and determines which are **directly applicable** vs. **contextually inapplicable** to the Job Hunter OS.

### **5.1 DIRECTLY APPLICABLE: Core Principles**

#### **Principle 1: Compete on Economics, Not Marketing**
- **What it means:** Don't rely on pretty fonts or clever wording. Rely on the undeniable value and clarity of your offer.
- **Application to Job Hunter OS:** Your 90-day plan + resume + cover letter stack MUST be so economically sound (ROI so clear) that the hiring manager can't ignore it.
- **How:** Calculate clear metrics in the 90-day plan (e.g., "Expected pipeline growth: +$2.5M in year 1 through these specific campaigns")

---

#### **Principle 2: The Ascension Framework**
- **Stages:**
  1. **Awareness** — You see a job posting
  2. **Interest** — Your application stands out
  3. **Consideration** — They read your 90-day plan
  4. **Decision** — They offer you the role (or proceed to interview)

- **Each stage has a corresponding asset:**
  - Awareness → Application email (hook)
  - Interest → Resume (proof of capability)
  - Consideration → 90-day plan (proof of strategic thinking)
  - Decision → Interview performance (proof of execution ability)

- **Why it matters:** Missing ANY asset breaks the chain. A great resume without a 90-day plan leaves them unconvinced about strategy.

---

#### **Principle 3: Market Problem Identification (The "Everyone Wants But Can't Get" Framework)**
- **Alen's Method:** Look for what everyone in the market wants but can't achieve
  - **Example:** "Everyone wants to lose weight but can't lose weight" → This is the problem to solve
  
- **Applied to Job Hunter OS:**
  - **The hiring manager's problem:** "Everyone wants to hire a high-performing growth leader but struggles to find one who has already thought through our specific growth challenges"
  - **Your solution:** You've done that thinking (via the 90-day plan)

---

#### **Principle 4: Specificity Builds Trust**
- **What Alen says:** Generic outreach fails. Specific, localized insights build trust.
- **Application:** Every asset must reference specific company details:
  - Specific revenue targets they've announced
  - Specific product launches they're planning
  - Specific market dynamics they're facing
  - Specific leadership gaps or wins
  
- **How to execute:** Research phase must extract these specifics BEFORE generating assets

---

#### **Principle 5: The Value Equation (From Hormozi, but Alen applies it)**
- **Formula:** `(Dream Outcome × Likelihood of Achievement) / (Time Delay × Effort & Sacrifice)`

- **Applied to Job Application:**
  - **Dream Outcome:** Hire a leader who can drive $50M → $100M revenue
  - **Likelihood of Achievement:** High (you've proven this track record)
  - **Time Delay:** Low (your 90-day plan shows immediate action items)
  - **Effort & Sacrifice:** Low (you're providing the strategic thinking; they just execute)
  
  - **Result:** Very high value equation = hard to ignore

---

#### **Principle 6: Make Offers at Different Price Points (Adapted: Job Hunting Version)**
- **What Alen does:** Offer a free tier, mid-tier, and high-ticket tier to maximize conversion
- **Adapted for Job Hunt:**
  - **Tier 1 (Free/Low-Effort Entry):** Generic application (they always get this)
  - **Tier 2 (Medium Effort):** Personalized cover letter + tailored resume
  - **Tier 3 (High Effort/Value):** Above + custom 90-day plan + market research
  
  - **Strategy:** Only send Tier 3 to top-tier opportunities; use Tier 2 for secondary opportunities; Tier 1 only for exploratory/low-priority roles

---

#### **Principle 7: Short-Term vs. Long-Term Thinking (Messaging Adaptation)**
- **Alen's discovery:** Different audiences respond to different time horizons
  - **Short-term language:** "Results in 7 days"
  - **Long-term language:** "Build a sustainable system over 12 months"
  
- **Applied to Job Hunt:**
  - **For fast-growth startups:** Lead with short-term wins (Month 1: stabilize pipeline, Month 2: launch new campaign)
  - **For mature companies:** Lead with long-term vision (Year 1: foundation, Year 2-3: scale)
  
- **Copy implication:** Adjust your cover letter and 90-day plan language based on company stage

---

#### **Principle 8: Ad Efficacy Matrix (Alen's Framework)**
- **Two axes:**
  - **Realistic ↔ Too Good to Be True**
  - **Hard Work ↔ Easy Work**

- **Four quadrants:**
  1. **Realistic + Easy Work** = Effective (high conversion)
  2. **Realistic + Hard Work** = Effective but lower conversion
  3. **Too Good + Easy Work** = Scam vibes (lowest conversion)
  4. **Too Good + Hard Work** = Delusional (lowest conversion)

- **Applied to your messaging:**
  - **Stay in quadrant 1-2:**
    - REALISTIC: "I can grow your pipeline 40-60% in Year 1" (proven track record supports this)
    - EASY WORK for THEM: "Here's my 90-day plan; you just execute" (they don't have to figure it out)

---

#### **Principle 9: The Million-Dollar Market Message Matrix**
- **Core insight:** Market's willing to pay NOT to do something, not to DO something
  - **Example:** People pay for DoorDash not to go to the grocery store and cook
  - **Example:** People pay for ChatGPT not to research and write from scratch

- **Applied to Job Hunter OS:**
  - **What hiring managers pay for:** Someone who solves their problem WITHOUT requiring heavy management
  - **Your message:** "I've done the strategic thinking. You just execute."
  - **Reframe:** NOT "I can execute your strategy" but "I'm not making you figure out the strategy"

---

#### **Principle 10: Aftercare & Reducing Buyer's Remorse**
- **What Alen teaches:** Post-purchase communication balances the emotional/logical scales
  - After they say yes, continue communicating value to ensure they don't have remorse
  
- **Applied to Job Hunt:**
  - After you get an offer, DON'T go silent
  - Send follow-up emails, drafts of ideas, proof that you're already working on their problems
  - This reduces the risk that they reconsider the hire

---

#### **Principle 11: Short-Term Language Cuts CPAs in Half**
- **What Alen found:** When messaging emphasizes quick wins, cost-per-acquisition drops significantly
- **Examples of short-term language:**
  - "Results in 30 days"
  - "First 90 days: $2M pipeline impact"
  - "Within 6 weeks, you'll see..."

- **Applied to your 90-day plan:**
  - Front-load quick wins (Week 1-4)
  - Then show progression (Month 2-3)
  - This keeps hiring managers engaged because they see early proof points

---

### **5.2 CONTEXTUALLY INAPPLICABLE: Principles to Skip**

| **Principle** | **Why Inapplicable** | **Where It Would Apply (for reference)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Upsells & Downsells | You're not selling multiple products in a funnel; you're selling one outcome (the job) | Applies to SaaS, courses, membership models |
| Free Trial Offers | Can't offer a "free trial" of employment | Applies to software, services |
| CRM Automation at Scale | You're not managing 10,000 leads; you're targeting <50 high-quality roles | Applies to B2B sales teams, agencies |
| Content Monetization | Your content (90-day plans) isn't monetized; it's a means to an end | Applies to course creators, publishers |
| Multi-Channel Ad Spend Optimization | You don't have an ad budget; you're leveraging time and personalization | Applies to e-commerce, app launches |

---

### **5.3 Alen's "I Don't Want This" Framework (Applied to Job Filtering)**

**What Alen teaches:** Always know what you DON'T want before you pursue what you do want.

**Applied to Job Hunting:**
- What DISQUALIFIES a role instantly?
  - On-site requirement (you want remote)
  - Less than $150K base (below your floor)
  - No equity (you want upside)
  - Founder/team conflict signals (you can tell from LinkedIn/Crunchbase research)
  - Declining revenue or high churn (red flag)
  
- **Benefit:** This MECE filter saves 80% of your evaluation time by eliminating non-starters upfront

### **6.2 Decision Tree: "Which Framework Should I Use Right Now?"**

```
START: You have a decision to make
│
├─ "Is this a high-level system design question?"
│  └─ YES → Use SYSTEMS THINKING (map all parts, find bottlenecks)
│  └─ NO → Continue
│
├─ "Do I need to evaluate MULTIPLE OPTIONS and rank them?"
│  └─ YES → Use MECE ANALYSIS (create exhaustive, mutually exclusive categories)
│  └─ NO → Continue
│
├─ "Do I need to prevent failure or identify risks?"
│  └─ YES → Use INVERSION THINKING (what would guarantee failure? Prevent it.)
│  └─ NO → Continue
│
├─ "Are there HIDDEN CONSEQUENCES or ripple effects I should consider?"
│  └─ YES → Use SECOND-ORDER THINKING (trace the effects forward 2-3 steps)
│  └─ NO → Continue
│
├─ "Do I need to understand the END USER'S NEEDS and constraints?"
│  └─ YES → Use DESIGN THINKING (empathize with the hiring manager)
│  └─ NO → Continue
│
├─ "Do I need to QUICKLY TEST AND ITERATE on this decision?"
│  └─ YES → Use LEAN STARTUP / OODA LOOP (build, measure, learn)
│  └─ NO → Continue
│
├─ "Now, apply EXPERT TACTICS based on the unit of work:"
│  ├─ "Writing copy?" → Use Alen Sultanic's messaging principles (Ascension, Value Eq., Specificity)
│  ├─ "Prioritizing opportunities?" → Use Hormozi's value equation
│  ├─ "Designing user experience?" → Use Gary Vee's pillar + micro-content model
│  ├─ "Deciding on company culture fit?" → Use Rory Sutherland's psycho-logic
│  └─ "Iterating the system?" → Use Eric Ries's Build-Measure-Learn loop
│
END: Apply the framework. Make the decision. Document the assumptions.
```

## 7. IMPLEMENTATION PLAYBOOK: SYSTEM OPTIMIZATION CHECKLIST

Use this checklist before implementing ANY change to the Job Hunter OS.

### **7.1 Pre-Implementation Checklist**

**BEFORE you code, write, or change anything:**

- [ ] **Systems Thinking Check**
  - What are the inputs, processes, and outputs of this change?
  - How will this change affect other parts of the system?
  - Are there any feedback loops or second-order effects?
  
- [ ] **Inversion Thinking Check**
  - What would go wrong if we DON'T make this change?
  - What could go wrong IF we DO make this change?
  - How do we prevent the worst-case scenario?

- [ ] **MECE Analysis Check (if building new module/categorization)**
  - Are the categories mutually exclusive? (no overlap)
  - Are they collectively exhaustive? (no gaps)
  - Is there a cleaner way to organize?

- [ ] **Design Thinking Check**
  - Who is the end user of this change? (You? Hiring managers? Both?)
  - What is their job-to-be-done?
  - Have we prototyped or tested this with them?

- [ ] **Lean Startup Check**
  - What's the hypothesis we're testing?
  - What's the minimum viable version?
  - How will we measure success?
  - What will we do if it fails?

---

### **7.2 Asset Quality Checklist (Before Sending Any Application)**

**For EVERY job application, use this checklist:**

#### **Resume Quality Check**
- [ ] **Specificity (Alen):** Does it reference specific metrics and outcomes, not generic responsibilities?
  - ✅ "Grew revenue from $20.5M to $45M (120% YoY growth)"
  - ❌ "Responsible for growth initiatives"

- [ ] **Hierarchy (Systems Thinking):** Are the most relevant achievements listed first?
  - Top 3 bullets for THIS role's requirements
  - Secondary bullets for supporting skills

- [ ] **Compete on Economics (Alen):** Does it make the ROI obvious?
  - For every achievement, ask: "What was the business impact?"
  - Include dollar amounts, percentages, or scalability

#### **Cover Letter Quality Check**
- [ ] **Value Equation (Hormozi):** Does it maximize dream outcome, likelihood, and minimize time delay?
  - Dream outcome: Clear about what you'll achieve for them
  - Likelihood: Specific proof from your background
  - Time delay: "I've already done the strategic thinking"
  - Effort: "You just execute"

- [ ] **Specificity (Alen):** Does it reference specific company details?
  - Specific market dynamics they're facing
  - Specific revenue targets or product launches
  - Specific competitor threats or opportunities
  
- [ ] **Ad Efficacy (Alen):** Does it feel realistic, not too good to be true?
  - Stay in quadrants 1-2 (realistic + easy work for them)
  - Avoid overselling or empty promises

- [ ] **Psycho-Logic (Rory):** Does it appeal to emotion as well as logic?
  - Logic: Specific achievements and plans
  - Emotion: Your passion for their specific challenges

#### **90-Day Plan Quality Check**
- [ ] **Ascension Framework (Alen):** Does it walk them through discovery → planning → execution?
  - Week 1-2: Deep dive into existing performance (diagnosis)
  - Week 3-4: Recommend priority initiatives
  - Month 2: Launch first campaigns
  - Month 3: Measure, iterate, scale

- [ ] **Value Equation (Hormozi):** Does it make the ROI crystal clear?
  - Expected pipeline impact: $X by end of Q1
  - Expected revenue impact: $Y by end of Q2
  - Specific metrics you'll track

- [ ] **Short-Term Wins (Alen):** Do you front-load quick wins?
  - Week 1-2: Identify low-hanging fruit
  - By Week 4: First quick win (e.g., optimize email campaigns, recover lost deals)
  - This keeps them engaged

- [ ] **Bloom's Taxonomy Check:** Does it progress from analysis → evaluation → creation?
  - Analyze: What's broken in their current growth engine?
  - Evaluate: Why is it broken? What should change?
  - Create: Here's the new strategy I'd implement

---

### **7.3 Iteration Cycle Checklist (Build-Measure-Learn)**

**Every 10-15 applications, pause and iterate:**

- [ ] **Measure:** How many responses did we get? Interview rate? Offer rate?
  - Track by job level, company stage, industry, application format
  
- [ ] **Learn:** What worked? What didn't?
  - Did personalized cover letters help? (compare A/B split)
  - Did 90-day plans lead to more interviews? (compare with/without)
  - Did short-term language drive more responses? (compare messaging variants)

- [ ] **Hypothesize:** What will we change for the next batch?
  - Adjust messaging based on learnings
  - Refine 90-day plan template
  - Shift job filtering criteria if needed

- [ ] **Act:** Implement changes in next batch of applications

- [ ] **Document:** Record what changed, what the hypothesis was, and what the result was
  - This becomes your system's feedback loop
