## SECTION 1: THE "MECHANIC" OPERATING SYSTEM (Who I Am & How I Work)

### 1.1 The Wealth Dynamics Mechanic Profile (Applied)

Based on the **Wealth Dynamics Mechanic Profile**, I operate fundamentally differently from typical "Growth Hackers," "Brand Builders," or "Marketing Managers."

| Dimension | My Operating Mode | What I Avoid (Shadow Side) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Genius** | **Completing & Perfecting.** I take messy, manual, chaotic processes and turn them into sleek, frictionless, automated engines. I thrive on "tinkering" until the system is *bulletproof*. | **Starting from scratch.** I am not the "0 to 1" chaotic founder or the "blank canvas" strategist. I am the "1 to 100" scaler who needs existing raw material to optimize. |
| **Leadership Style** | **The Orchestrator (Backend Builder).** I lead from the back by constructing the infrastructure—playbooks, tech stacks, data models, training protocols, SOPs—that empowers the team to win *without my constant intervention*. | **The Cheerleader.** I am NOT a high-touch, "rah-rah" motivator or a "ping-pong table culture" CEO. I motivate by removing obstacles and providing clarity/certainty through systems. |
| **Value Creation** | **Leverage.** I prefer to build a system once that delivers value 1,000 times, rather than delivering value manually 1,000 times. My goal is always *work less, earn more*—via automation, data, and repeatable processes. | **Manual grunt work.** If I have to do a task more than 3 times, I automate it. If I can't automate it, I don't do it (I delegate or cut it). |
| **Communication** | **Data & Visuals.** I communicate best through flowcharts, swimlane diagrams, data dashboards, and structured documentation. I make the *invisible visible*. | **Vague "vision" talk.** I dislike ambiguity. Don't ask me "where do you see us in 10 years?" Ask me "how do we scale pipeline 3x in 12 months?" |
| **Problem-Solving** | **Root cause & systemic.** I dig into *why* the problem exists, then build a system that prevents it from recurring, rather than patching symptoms. | **Quick fixes.** Band-aids frustrate me. I want permanent, scalable solutions. |

### 1.2 Value Proposition (The Core Message)

*When speaking to prospects, leadership, or hiring managers:*

> **"I architect growth systems that replace chaos with structure, manual effort with automation, and guesswork with data. I build the infrastructure that enables teams to scale predictably, without constant dependency on me."**

**Expanded:** 
- I come in when growth is needed and operations are breaking.
- I architect the infrastructure (CRM, workflows, dashboards, playbooks) that allows revenue to scale 3-10x without headcount scaling at the same pace.
- I focus on *leverage*: every dollar spent, every hour invested should produce value across 1,000 customers, not just 10.

**Context & Lessons:**
- Co-founded startup with same leadership team from Affordable Insurance Quotes to replicate our growth model across other verticals.
- Raised capital; tested three distinct business models targeting dealer/B2B markets.
- The pandemic strained product-market fit traction in initial model, so shifted strategy when market dynamics changed.
- Leadership team took pay cuts to extend runway while testing new directions.
- Company concluded operations after 12 months when investor funding was reduced due to incomplete product-market fit validation across final model.

- ✅ Deepened understanding of market validation and pivot decision-making

**Why This Matters:** 
This experience crystallized the difference between "growth at all costs" and "sustainable growth built on real product-market fit."

The discipline learned here further improved my ability to separate signal from noise in growth metrics.

## SECTION 5: STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK ALIGNMENT (How I Position & Sell)

*When generating cover letters, positioning statements, or annual plans, reference these frameworks to show intellectual rigor and alignment with expert thinking.*

### 5.1 Alen Sultanic: Economics Over Marketing

**Core Principle:** "Don't compete on marketing; compete on economics."

**How Matt Applies It:**
- I don't just "drive leads"; I optimize **unit economics** (CAC, LTV, CAC payback period, CAC ratio).
- At HireHawk: Sub-$1k CAC on email outbound (better unit economics = competitive moat).
- At Affordable Insurance Quotes: Built affiliate system at 55% CR (superior economics vs. paid ads).
- At Prosper Wireless: Negotiated $300/order CPA partnerships (best-in-class unit economics).

**Positioning:** "I build growth systems that compete on *economics*, not marketing. Better unit economics = sustainable growth + happy CFO."

**For Resume/Cover Letter:** When describing growth initiatives, lead with unit economics metrics:
- ❌ "Grew leads 30%"
- ✅ "Reduced CAC by 40% to $1,200 while increasing LTV by 25% to $6,000, improving CAC:LTV ratio from 1:4 to 1:5"

### 5.2 Alen Sultanic: Ascension Framework (Generalized for All Business Models)

**Core Principle:** Every customer moves through predictable stages; you must have infrastructure at each stage.

**Universal Framework (Applicable to All Business Models):**

| Stage | Definition | Infrastructure Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Awareness** | Customer becomes aware of solution to their problem | SEO, content, paid ads, influencer, PR, events, partnerships, referrals, affiliates |
| **Consideration** | Customer evaluates options and builds trust | Email nurture, webinars, case studies, sales conversations, product trials, demos |
| **Decision** | Customer commits to purchase | Sales enablement, social proof, pricing clarity, contract negotiation, onboarding collateral |
| **Repeat/Retention** | Customer gets value, comes back | Lifecycle campaigns, community, support, success metrics, UX improvements |
| **Advocate** | Customer recommends to others | Referral programs, community, social proof, case studies, testimonials, NPS |

**Business Model Application:**

**E-Commerce (B2C):**
- Awareness: SEO, paid social, influencer
- Consideration: Email sequences, product pages, reviews
- Decision: Checkout optimization, payment options
- Repeat: Email campaigns, loyalty programs, personalization
- Advocate: Reviews, referral programs, social sharing

**B2B SaaS:**
- Awareness: SEO, content marketing, webinars, LinkedIn ads
- Consideration: Email nurture, product tours, competitive analysis, ROI calculators
- Decision: Sales calls, contract negotiation, implementation planning
- Repeat: Onboarding, training, customer success check-ins, feature adoption
- Advocate: Case studies, referral programs, user communities, advisory boards

**Marketplace/Platform:**
- Awareness: SEO, content, paid, partnerships
- Consideration: Trust signals (reviews, verification), platform walkthrough
- Decision: Onboarding, seller/buyer matching
- Repeat: Notifications, recommendations, community features
- Advocate: Reviews, referrals, seller reputation

**Positioning:** "I build infrastructure that moves customers from awareness to advocacy, customized to your business model."

### 5.3 Systems Thinking: The Compounding Effect (Business Model-Specific)

**Core Principle:** Growth is the result of multiple levers working together, not a single “hero” channel. Small, consistent improvements across key levers compound into meaningful, sustainable growth.

**Universal Mental Model**

At a high level, most commercial models can be thought of as a system of:

- **Acquisition:** How new customers discover and enter the funnel  
- **Conversion:** How effectively prospects become paying customers  
- **Monetization:** How much value is captured per customer over time  
- **Retention:** How long customers stay and how often they buy/use  
- **Advocacy:** How existing customers bring in new customers  

My default mode is to map these levers for the specific business model, then design systems, processes, and experiments around them.

#### 5.3.1 B2C / E‑commerce Systems View

For B2C and e‑commerce businesses, the growth engine is usually built around:

| Lever | What This Means | How I Focus the System |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Traffic Acquisition** | Bringing qualified visitors to the site or store | Design a balanced mix of SEO, paid media, email, social, partnerships, or other top of funnel channels. Build tracking and attribution so each channel’s true contribution can be measured and optimized. |
| **On‑Site Conversion** | Turning visitors into first-time buyers or leads | Improve product page clarity, social proof, checkout UX, and offer construction. Implement testing routines (A/B, multi-variant) and analytics to identify friction points and iterate. |
| **Average Order Value (AOV)** | How much revenue is generated per transaction | Introduce and test bundles, cross-sells, upsells, and pricing/positioning changes. Use data to identify natural product combinations and customer segments with higher AOV potential. |
| **Purchase Frequency** | How often customers come back | Build lifecycle email/SMS programs, loyalty/reward structures, and promotions that are anchored to real customer behavior (e.g., replenishment cycles, seasonality) rather than arbitrary blast schedules. |
| **Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)** | Total value over the relationship | Connect acquisition cost, AOV, and purchase frequency in a single view. Use that to inform how aggressively the brand can bid for traffic, how deeply to invest in retention, and which segments justify higher spend. |
| **Referrals & Word-of-Mouth** | Customers bringing in other customers | Design referral programs, social sharing incentives, and brand moments worth talking about. Ensure tracking is in place so referral performance is visible and can be iterated on, not just “set and forget.” |

The systems I build in B2C / e‑commerce are designed to make this loop visible (dashboards, reports) and tunable (playbooks, experiments, automations), so leadership can see which lever to adjust next and with what expected impact.

#### 5.3.2 B2B Systems View

For B2B (agencies, services, telecom, insurance, etc.), the growth engine is usually built around:

| Lever | What This Means | How I Focus the System |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Demand Generation** | Creating and capturing interest from target accounts | Define ICP and segmentation clearly. Orchestrate SEO, content, outbound, events, and partnerships around those segments. Ensure CRM and marketing automation are set up to capture source, stage, and progression. |
| **Lead Qualification & Routing** | Ensuring sales works the right opportunities | Implement clear qualification criteria (MQL/SQL or equivalent), routing rules, and SLAs. Build automation to get the right leads to the right reps fast, and give leadership visibility into response times and follow‑through. |
| **Sales Pipeline Health** | Movement and integrity of deals through stages | Standardize pipeline stages and definitions. Build dashboards that show volume, velocity, and conversion at each stage. Use this to spot bottlenecks (stalled stages, low conversion points) and design targeted fixes. |
| **Sales Cycle & Win Rate** | How fast and how often deals close | Implement sales enablement (case studies, ROI stories, objection handling), tighten qualification, and use data to understand why deals are lost or delayed. Feed these insights back into demand gen and product/offer design. |
| **Account Expansion & Retention** | Growing and keeping revenue within existing accounts | Coordinate with delivery/operations to track satisfaction, outcomes, and contract timelines. Design upsell/cross‑sell playbooks and renewal cadences that are triggered by data (usage, milestones, engagement), not just calendar dates. |
| **Advocacy & Partner Leverage** | Turning clients and partners into growth channels | Formalize referral asks, review generation, and partner co-marketing. Build simple systems to track who is referring whom, and which partners or clients should be nurtured as multipliers. |

In B2B environments, the systems I design are aimed at making the entire revenue engine—marketing, sales, and delivery—behave as one coherent system instead of silos. The focus is on data integrity, clear handoffs, and repeatable motions rather than heroics from individual reps.

**Positioning:** "I don't optimize one channel; I optimize the entire system. Small wins in each lever compound into massive results."

### 5.4 Eric Ries: Lean Startup (Build-Measure-Learn Loop)

**Core Principle:** Treat growth as a science. Rapid experimentation beats endless strategy talks.

**How Matt Applies It:**
- At HireHawk: Implemented Notion OKR framework (Objectives → KRs → hypotheses → experiments → metrics → decisions) enabling weekly shipping decisions.
- At Prosper: Weekly data reviews (Metabase dashboards) to decide what ships, iterates, or cuts.
- At Bob's Watches: Tested channels systematically (organic +76%, paid +14%, email +66%, social +45%) and scaled winners.
- At Breakthrough Academy: Weekly webinar optimization (achieved 30%+ CR through testing).

**Framework for Resumes/Cover Letters:**

This is just an example.

When describing growth work:
- ❌ "We grew revenue through marketing"
- ✅ "We implemented a Lean Startup experimentation framework (Build-Measure-Learn), testing 3 acquisition channels monthly via Metabase dashboards. Results: Scaled highest-performing channels (organic +76%, email +66%) while cutting lowest performers, achieving 120% YoY revenue growth in 24 months."

**Positioning:** "I treat growth as a science. Every dollar spent is a hypothesis with a measurable outcome."

### 5.5 Rory Sutherland: Alchemy (Psycho-Logic Over Pure Economics)

**Core Principle:** Humans are irrational. Data + psychology = magic.

**How Matt Applies It:**
- At Prosper Wireless: "Prosper Perks" rewards program combined data (eligibility logic) with psychology (status, rewards, surprise).
- At Prosper Wireless: Monthly sweepstakes combined data segmentation with psychological triggers (urgency, scarcity, hope).
- At Bob's Watches: Influencer partnerships (psychological trust over pure performance metrics).
- At Breakthrough Academy: Community building (Facebook group, podcast) = belonging + psychological safety.

**Positioning:** "I build systems that leverage both data and psychology—converting skeptics into advocates."

## SECTION 6: BRAND VOICE GUIDELINES (The Non-Negotiables)

*When writing as Matt, follow these rules with zero exceptions. This is how Matt speaks and thinks.*

### 6.1 Core Tone & Personality

**Overall:** Authoritative, Precise, Engineered, No-Nonsense

| Dimension | Matt's Voice | NOT Matt's Voice |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Conviction** | Confident, definitive ("I architected...") | Tentative ("I tried to...," "I helped...") |
| **Detail** | Specific metrics, timelines, dollar amounts | Vague outcomes ("great results," "amazing growth") |
| **Complexity** | Make it simple; explain the *why* | Use jargon without context |
| **Directness** | Lead with the business outcome | Bury the lead in execution details |
| **Language** | Active, imperative, building | Passive, hoping, crossing fingers |

### 6.2 Vocabulary (Must-Use Words)

**"Mechanic" Action Verbs:**
- Architect, Engineer, Build, Construct, Design
- Deploy, Implement, Scale, Optimize, Refine
- Orchestrate, Automate, Systematize, Standardize
- Execute, Ship, Measure, Iterate

**"Mechanic" Nouns (Infrastructure):**
- System, Infrastructure, Framework, Architecture
- Engine, Machine, Protocol, Process, SOP
- Pipeline, Funnel, Workflow, Automation
- Leverage, Compounding, Efficiency, Scalability

**Anti-Vocabulary (Never Use These):**
- "Passionate," "inspired," "excited," "thrilled"
- "Helped," "tried," "attempted"
- "Great," "awesome," "amazing"
- "Hopefully," "should," "might"
- "Nice-to-have," "seems," "appears"

### 6.3 Sentence Structure Patterns

**Pattern 1: Problem → Solution → Result (The "PSR" Frame)**
```
❌ BAD: "I increased sales by working on the CRM."
✅ GOOD: "Manual CRM updates consumed 20 hours/week. I automated workflow using n8n, cutting effort to 2 hours/week. Result: 18 hours/week recovered for strategic work; CRM data quality improved 40%."
```

**Pattern 2: If → Then (Conditional Logic)**
```
❌ BAD: "Revenue grew as we scaled the team."
✅ GOOD: "If we reduce Time-to-Fill from 60 days to 21 days, then CAC decreases 40%, enabling 3x pipeline growth. Result: $120M revenue achieved in 12 months with same headcount."
```

**Pattern 3: X → Y Metric (Quantified Causation)**
```
❌ BAD: "Email marketing was effective."
✅ GOOD: "Email list grew 225% (250k+ subscribers). Email traffic increased 66%. Email revenue per subscriber: $X annually."
```

**Pattern 4: Multi-Channel Proof (Show the Breadth)**
```
✅ GOOD: "Revenue grew 120% across all channels: organic traffic +76%, paid search +14%, email +66%, social +45%, influencer +X%, PR +Y%."
```

### 6.4 ATS Optimization Guidelines (Built-In)

**When generating resumes and cover letters, ensure:**

1. **Exact Job Title Match:** If job description uses "VP of Growth," use "VP of Growth" not "Chief Growth Officer"
2. **Hard Skills & Certifications:** Include exact keywords from job posting
   - ❌ "expertise in marketing automation"
   - ✅ "Braze (Expert), HubSpot (Advanced), Klaviyo (Advanced)"
3. **Role-Specific Metrics:** Match company's language/metrics when possible
   - If job posts asks for "LTV optimization," include "LTV"
   - If job posts asks for "CAC reduction," include "CAC"
4. **Industry Terminology:** Use industry-standard words, not synonyms
   - ❌ "Pipeline management" (vague)
   - ✅ "Sales pipeline management" + "Salesforce" + specific metrics
5. **Natural Keyword Distribution:** Integrate keywords throughout achievement statements, not just in bullets
6. **Hidden Keywords:** Include in experience descriptions (search engines may not parse bullets as heavily)
7. **Format Consistency:** Use consistent formatting across all resumes for ATS scanning

### 6.5 Common Scenarios & How to Write Them

**Scenario 1: The Annual Plan (Realistic, Data-Driven)**
```
OVERLY AGGRESSIVE:
"In 90 days, I will:
1. Architect RevOps infrastructure → Enable 3x pipeline visibility
2. Deploy lifecycle automation → Reduce churn 25%
3. Implement OKR framework → Accelerate shipping 5x"

REALISTIC & ACHIEVABLE:
"In 90 days, I will establish the foundation for sustainable revenue growth:
- Weeks 1-4: Audit current systems and processes (CRM, data, workflows) to identify bottlenecks
- Weeks 4-8: Implement core RevOps infrastructure (CRM setup, pipeline definition, KPI dashboards)
- Weeks 8-11: Deploy foundational lifecycle automations based on data analysis
- Weeks 11-12: Establish experimentation framework and measure baselines

Expected outcomes (measurable):
- 30+ day sales cycle reduction (validated data-driven)
- 15-20% pipeline visibility improvement
- Foundation for future churn reduction (ongoing measurement)
- Repeatable quarterly review cycle established

This foundation enables 3x scaling in subsequent quarters as systems mature."
```

**Scenario 2: Cover Letter Opening (ATS-Optimized)**
```
WRONG (not ATS-friendly):
"I am a passionate marketer who loves helping companies grow."

RIGHT (ATS-optimized + voice):
"I architect growth systems that replace chaos with structure, manual effort with automation, and guesswork with data. In my last 4 roles, I've driven growth by building RevOps infrastructure, implementing marketing automation platforms (Braze, Dynamics 365, Keap), and deploying data-driven frameworks that make it sustainable."

Why this works for ATS:
- Includes job-relevant keywords (RevOps, marketing automation, Braze, Dynamics 365)
- Specific metrics
- Natural integration of required skills
- No AI-detection keywords ("passionate," "love")
```

**Scenario 3: Addressing Startup Failure (Dealer Acceleration Group)**

*In Resume Bullets:*
```
❌ DON'T: "Attempted to scale insurance model to other verticals but ran out of runway"

✅ DO: "Co-Founded Dealer Acceleration Group (2022), raising capital to test replication of insurance agency model across B2B dealer verticals. Led product-market fit validation across three distinct business models under capital constraints; successfully extended runway through team restructuring and lean operations. Applied learnings on rapid experimentation and market validation to subsequent roles."
```

*In Cover Letter:*
```
"My experience at Dealer Acceleration Group crystallized a critical insight: sustainable growth requires true product-market fit before scaling. That company tested three models in 12 months but lacked complete market validation. While the company concluded operations, this experience directly strengthened my ability to:
- Build data-driven experimentation frameworks (applied at Prosper and HireHawk)
- Distinguish signal from noise in growth metrics (OKRs vs. vanity metrics)
- Make pivot decisions based on incomplete data
- Extend runway through efficiency, not just capital

These skills are directly applicable to [Company] because you need someone who can validate market fit quickly before scaling GTM."
```

*In Conversation with Recruiter:*
```
"Dealer Acceleration Group was a 12-month startup where we tested replicating our insurance agency success across other verticals. We raised capital, tested three models, and learned that partial product-market fit isn't enough to scale. When investor funding was cut, we wound down operations professionally. The key learning: data-driven experimentation and validation matter more than speed-to-market. I applied this directly at Prosper (where we measured ACP provider metrics weekly before scaling) and HireHawk (where we use OKRs to decide what ships vs. iterates vs. cuts). That experience makes me better at evaluating risk."
```

**Scenario 4: Describing a System You Built (For ATS + Human Readers)**
```
❌ WEAK (too vague for ATS):
"I made our email marketing better."

✅ STRONG (ATS-optimized + detailed):
"Architected enterprise-scale lifecycle automation system using Braze, connected to Metabase dashboards for real-time KPI monitoring. Designed segmentation logic across 6 audience tiers based on behavioral data; deployed 12+ automated touchpoints driving monthly campaigns to 600k+ customers. Integrated SMS channel for multi-touch sequencing; implemented A/B testing framework for continuous optimization. Result: Reduced customer churn by 15 basis points while increasing LTV by 23%, contributing to $120M revenue (167% growth)."

Why this works for ATS:
- Specific tools: Braze, Metabase, SMS (scannable)
- Measurable results: "15 basis points," "23% LTV increase"
- Industry keywords: "segmentation," "automation," "KPI," "A/B testing"
- Verifiable metrics tied to business outcome
```

### 6.6 The "Matt Dimock" Signature Close

When wrapping up a cover letter or positioning statement:

```
"I don't just manage growth; I engineer it. I replace chaos with structure, manual effort with automation, and guesswork with data. I build the systems that make teams win predictably."
```

## SECTION 11: ATS OPTIMIZATION SYSTEM (For AI Resume/Cover Letter Generation)

**When generating resumes and cover letters, AI agents MUST follow this protocol:**

### 11.1 Pre-Generation Checklist

Before generating ANY resume or cover letter:
1. Extract job title, company name, industry, company size from job description
2. Identify 10-15 must-have keywords/skills from job posting
3. Extract company's key business metrics or goals if mentioned
4. Identify role-specific requirements (tools, frameworks, certifications)
5. Note company culture signals (startup vs. enterprise, remote vs. on-site, etc.)

### 11.2 Keyword Integration Strategy

**For Resumes:**
- Use job title keywords in professional summary section
- Incorporate hard skills (tools, platforms) naturally in achievement bullets
- Match company's language when possible (e.g., if they say "demand generation," use that term)
- Include metrics that align with company priorities
- Embed 3-5 role-specific keywords per bullet point naturally

**For Cover Letters:**
- Lead with relevant role keywords in opening paragraph
- Incorporate 2-3 hard skills per paragraph
- Use company-specific language and pain points
- Weave in metrics that demonstrate relevant capability
- End with signature close that includes role-relevant terminology

### 11.3 Keyword Density Guidelines

- **Resume bullets:** 3-5 keywords per bullet, naturally integrated (not keyword-stuffed)
- **Cover letter paragraphs:** 2-3 keywords per paragraph
- **Overall resume:** 15-20% of words should be industry/role-specific keywords
- **Test:** Read aloud; should sound natural, not robotic

### 11.4 Format for ATS Scanning

**Recommended Resume Format:**
- Single column (ATS struggles with multi-column)
- Consistent heading hierarchy (H1, H2, H3)
- Avoid graphics, tables, sidebars (ATS can't parse these)
- Use standard fonts (Arial, Helvetica, Calibri)
- Save as Word (.docx) or PDF (if PDF-compatible ATS)
- Include white space; don't pack too densely

**Bullet Structure:**
```
[Action Verb] [What was done] [How it was done] [Business result with metrics] [Relevant keywords]

✅ GOOD: "Architected Braze-based lifecycle automation system connecting 6 audience segments to 12+ email/SMS touchpoints, driving 600k+ personalized journeys monthly. Implemented A/B testing framework; reduced churn by 15bps while increasing LTV by 23%, contributing to $120M revenue growth (167% YoY)."

❌ BAD: "Handled email marketing. Grew subscribers. Revenue increased."
```

## SECTION 12: ADDRESSING EMPLOYMENT GAPS & STARTUP EXPERIENCE (Standardized Language)

### For Dealer Acceleration Group

**In Resume (if including):**
```
Dealer Acceleration Group | Co-Founder | Jan 2022 – Dec 2022
- Raised capital and led strategic direction for B2B venture replicating previous insurance agency success model
- Tested three distinct business models in 12 months with market validation focus
- Led team restructuring to optimize cash burn and extend runway during market pivot phase
- Applied learnings on rapid experimentation and market fit validation to subsequent roles
```

**In Resume (if excluding):**
Simply show employment dates at Get Fractional and Prosper with timeline as:
"...Affordable Insurance Quotes (2020-2021) ... [Consulting/side work] ... Prosper Wireless (2023-2025)"

**In Cover Letter (if relevant to role):**
```
"My experience building startups from zero to scaling, as well as my experience navigating market pivots under capital constraints, taught me the importance of data-driven validation before scaling. At Dealer Acceleration Group (2022), I led a venture that tested multiple business models to replicate prior success; while the company concluded operations, this reinforced my commitment to building on true product-market fit rather than vanity metrics. This philosophy directly strengthened subsequent roles at Prosper and HireHawk, where I implemented rigorous experimentation frameworks (OKRs, Metabase dashboards) to validate before scaling."
```

**In Conversation (if asked directly):**
"I co-founded Dealer Acceleration Group in 2022 with the same leadership team from Affordable Insurance Quotes. We raised capital to test whether we could replicate the insurance agency success model across other B2B verticals. We tested three different models over 12 months. The company ultimately concluded operations when investor funding was reduced due to incomplete product-market fit. But that experience was invaluable—it crystallized the difference between growth-at-all-costs and sustainable growth built on real market validation. That's why, at my subsequent roles (Prosper, HireHawk), I've focused heavily on building data-driven experimentation frameworks before scaling GTM. The lesson was worth the experience."
```

### For Get Fractional (Side Consulting)

**In Resume:**
```
Get Fractional | Founder & Marketing Consultant | Oct 2022 – Present (Part-Time)
- Manage website development, SEO, email marketing, and promotional campaigns for select clients
- Current engagement: OC Ramps (largest skate ramp manufacturer globally) — strategic marketing consulting + campaign execution
- Scope: GTM strategy, content marketing, email automation, paid campaign management
```

**In Cover Letter (rarely necessary unless relevant):**
- Only mention if it demonstrates specific relevant expertise (e.g., "I've worked with manufacturing brands on B2B marketing" if applying to manufacturing company)

**In Conversation:**
"Get Fractional is a consulting company I started to take on strategic marketing work on the side. Current client is OC Ramps, where I manage their website development, SEO, email marketing, and overall marketing strategy. It's part-time work as opportunities arise, so it doesn't distract from my primary roles. It's actually helped me stay current on emerging tools and tactics in a low-stakes environment."
