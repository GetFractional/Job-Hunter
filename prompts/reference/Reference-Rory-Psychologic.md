# Reference Prompt: Rory Sutherland Psycho-Logic & Perception Design

## 📌 PURPOSE
This reference guide applies **Rory Sutherland's Psycho-Logic principles** (perception > reality, emotion > logic, irrationality as design) to **Job Hunter OS messaging**. It answers: How do you make hiring managers FEEL like you're the right choice, not just think it?

**When Used**: Cover letters, 90-day plans, interview narratives, outreach messages
**Input**: Your achievements + hiring manager psychology
**Output**: Messaging that appeals to emotion + logic simultaneously
**Success Metric**: Hiring manager feels understood and emotionally invested BEFORE rationally evaluating

---

## 🧠 CORE PRINCIPLE: PSYCHO-LOGIC OVER LOGIC

### Definition
**Psycho-Logic**: People make decisions based on perception and emotion, then justify with logic. Master the perception, and logic follows.

### The Job Hunting Application

| Dimension | Pure Logic | Psycho-Logic |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| **What Hiring Manager Hears** | "I increased revenue 40%" | "I compressed sales cycles so your best reps could close 2x more deals, making them happier + you richer" |
| **What They Feel** | Neutral (resume number) | Understood (you get their constraints) + Excited (upside) |
| **Decision Basis** | "This person has skills" | "This person understands our world" |
| **Conviction** | Moderate ("could work") | Strong ("must hire") |

### Why Psycho-Logic Works in Job Context

Hiring managers are **irrational** in predictable ways:

1. **Confirmation Bias**: They want to believe you can execute
2. **Social Proof**: They want others to think they made a smart hire
3. **Status Quo Bias**: They're nervous about change
4. **Loss Aversion**: Fear of hiring wrong > hope of hiring right
5. **Emotional First**: They decide emotionally, justify logically

**Your job**: Address all 5 by using psycho-logic in your messaging.

## 🎯 THE FOUR PSYCHO-LOGIC PATTERNS

### Pattern 1: Perception Over Reality

**Principle**: How something is framed matters more than what it is.

**Examples**:
```
❌ LOGIC: "I managed a team of 8 people"
✅ PSYCHO-LOGIC: "I built a team from scratch that generated $2M in incremental revenue.
                  They consistently felt supported and motivated (reflected in low turnover).
                  They worked autonomously (reflected in execution speed)."

Why it works: Frames team size as outcome (capability) not input (responsibility)
```

```
❌ LOGIC: "I've worked at 4 companies"
✅ PSYCHO-LOGIC: "I've built growth engines at 4 different company stages:
                  - Early stage: Went from 0 to product-market fit signals
                  - Growth stage: Scaled GTM from $500K to $5M ARR
                  - Scale stage: Built demand gen at $50M+ ARR company
                  - Today: I understand what each stage needs to win"

Why it works: Frames job changes as strategic learning, not flakiness
```

### Pattern 2: Emotion Before Logic

**Principle**: Make them FEEL understood first. Logic follows.

**Structure**:
```
Emotional Hook (They feel understood):
"You're at the point where the playbook that got you to $50M doesn't work anymore.
You need someone who knows the $50M→$100M inflection point."

Logical Proof (They justify with logic):
"I've done this twice before. At Company A: $40M→$90M. At Company B: $60M→$110M.
Here's my playbook: [specific methodology]"

Result: They FEEL like you get them + have PROOF you can execute
```

**Application to Each Asset**:

**Cover Letter**:
```
Emotional (First paragraph):
"I know what it feels like to be at your inflection point.
You built something great. Now growth is slowing.
That's not because your team isn't good - it's because the old playbook breaks."

Logical (Second paragraph):
"Here's why it breaks [specific reason].
Here's how I'd fix it [specific methodology].
Here's proof I've done this [examples + metrics]"
```

**90-Day Plan**:
```
Emotional:
"The hidden burden at Series C is that everyone's busy executing the old model.
Nobody has capacity to think about the new model.
That's where I come in."

Logical:
"Week 1-2: I diagnose what the new model should be.
Week 3: I present findings for your decision.
Week 4+: I execute while your team focuses on running the business"
```

### Pattern 3: Irrationality as Design (Psychological Signals)

**Principle**: Use psychological signals that trigger buying decisions, even when people aren't consciously aware.

#### Signal 1: Scarcity
```
❌ WRONG: "I'm very interested in this role"
✅ RIGHT: "I'm being very selective about my next role.
          Only roles that match these 3 criteria: [specific].
          Yours is one of 3 companies I'm actively pursuing.
          Worth discussing if you're serious?"
```

Why: Creates urgency (you have other options) without being desperate

#### Signal 2: Confidence Through Specificity
```
❌ WRONG: "I think I can help grow your business"
✅ RIGHT: "I know exactly what needs to happen:
          Sales cycle compression is your #1 lever.
          You're missing qualification framework.
          I'll implement our proven 60-30-10 model.
          You'll see 30% compression in 90 days.
          If it doesn't work, you know what to do differently next time."
```

Why: Specificity signals confidence, removes uncertainty

#### Signal 3: Social Proof (Implicit)
```
❌ WRONG: "Other companies have hired me and seen great results"
✅ RIGHT: "When I joined Company A, they were at $40M ARR plateau.
          18 months later: $90M ARR.
          When I joined Company B, they had 60-day sales cycle.
          6 months later: 40-day cycle, $3M additional ARR."
```

Why: Specific examples from others validate your approach better than claims about yourself

#### Signal 4: Authority Through Pattern Recognition
```
❌ WRONG: "I'm experienced in growth"
✅ RIGHT: "I've solved the same 3 problems across every company I've worked at:
          Problem 1: Sales cycle efficiency
          Problem 2: Lead quality
          Problem 3: Team scaling efficiency
          Your company faces all 3 (I researched it).
          I have a system for each."
```

Why: Pattern suggests deep expertise, not just surface knowledge

### Pattern 4: The Halo Effect (Make Them Want to Hire You)

**Principle**: Create psychological momentum where each interaction makes hiring you feel like the right decision.

**The Halo Cascade**:
```
Touchpoint 1: Outreach Message (Specific, shows research)
→ Hiring manager thinks: "This person researched us deeply"
→ Halo: "Probably researches everything deeply"

Touchpoint 2: Cover Letter (Addresses their specific problem)
→ Hiring manager thinks: "They understand our exact challenge"
→ Halo: "Probably understands our industry deeply"

Touchpoint 3: 90-Day Plan (Shows clear methodology + previous wins)
→ Hiring manager thinks: "They've solved this before"
→ Halo: "Probably solves most things reliably"

Touchpoint 4: Interview (STAR stories + execution proof)
→ Hiring manager thinks: "They can actually execute"
→ Halo: "Probably our next hire"

By Interview 2: "How do we NOT hire this person?"
```

## 🎨 PSYCHO-LOGIC TECHNIQUES FOR EACH ASSET

### Cover Letter: The Emotional Bridge

**Technique 1: Contrast (Emotion Hook)**
```
"Before: Your sales team was great, but slow. They were checking boxes, not closing deals.
After: Your sales team is great AND fast. They're closing deals, building relationships, earning.
The difference? One framework. Three months."
```

Why: Paints emotional picture of "before" (current pain) and "after" (desired state)

**Technique 2: Status Preservation**
```
"Your playbook got you to $50M.
That playbook won't get you to $100M - it NEVER does at this stage.
So here's what we do: Keep your playbook, add 2 new components that address the new constraints."
```

Why: Preserves their status (they did great) while justifying change (but need more)

**Technique 3: Risk Reversal**
```
"I'm so confident about this approach:
- I'll outline exactly what success looks like
- We'll measure it weekly
- If we're not on track by Week 6, we'll pivot to Plan B
- Your risk is minimal because we'll know fast if it's working"
```

Why: Removes emotional fear of "what if this person is wrong?"

### 90-Day Plan: The Logical Justification

**Technique 1: De-risk Through Process**
```
"Week 1-2: DIAGNOSIS (No implementation risk)
I learn. You stay in status quo.
No team disruption. Just insights.

Week 3-4: RECOMMENDATION (Low implementation risk)
I recommend based on diagnosis.
You decide. No commitment yet.

Week 5-8: PILOT (Medium implementation risk)
We test on 1 part of the business.
Measure. If it works, expand. If not, pause.

Week 9-12: SCALE (Full implementation)
We roll out based on pilot proof"
```

Why: Shows you understand their risk aversion. Removes big-bet psychology.

**Technique 2: Emotional Momentum (Quick Wins)**
```
"Week 1-2: Diagnosis complete
Week 3: First metric moves (small win - 5% improvement)
Week 4: Second tactic deployed (medium win - 15% improvement)
Week 6: Proof of concept (major win - 30% improvement)
Week 8: Full rollout (scaling phase)"
```

Why: People stick with things when they see early wins (emotional satisfaction) not just promised future gains

**Technique 3: Autonomy Signal**
```
"Your CFO cares about ROI. Your CRO cares about execution. Your CEO cares about culture impact.
Each cares about something different. I'll communicate what each cares about.
You won't need to translate between teams - I'll do that."
```

Why: Shows you understand their world (not just growth in isolation)

### Outreach Message: The Psychological Hook

**Technique 1: Specificity (Intelligence Signal)**
```
"I saw your Q2 funding announcement ($25M Series C).
Your new hires suggest you're building out sales ops - 3 hires, all sales-adjacent roles.
That tells me you're optimizing for efficiency, not just volume.
I've done exactly that at [similar company]"
```

Why: Specificity signals intelligence. People want to hire smart people.

**Technique 2: Confidence (Authority Signal)**
```
"Most people in your situation try to grow faster.
You need to grow smarter.
Faster leads to burnout. Smarter leads to scale.
I know the difference because I've done both wrong"
```

Why: Confidence + admitting mistakes = genuine authority (not arrogance)

### Interview: The Narrative Arc

**Technique 1: STAR Stories (Emotional Proof)**
```
SITUATION: "I walked into a company that had grown to $50M but hit a wall at 30% growth"
TASK: "I was brought in to get growth moving again"
ACTION: "I diagnosed it was a sales cycle compression issue, not a demand issue. 
         Most people would try to generate more leads.
         I attacked cycle time instead."
RESULT: "Sales cycle went from 120→60 days. Revenue grew 45% Year over Year.
         Team felt empowered (closing more) instead of pressured (generating more)"
```

Why: Stories bypass logic and go straight to emotional conviction

**Technique 2: The Emotional Close**
```
"When I look at your company, I see a team that's built something great.
You're at the inflection point where you need someone who knows how to take that great thing
and make it scale without breaking it.
That's what I do. That's what I've always done.
And I'm excited about doing it here because [specific reason about their company]"
```

Why: Ends on emotion (excitement + understanding) not logic (here's my plan)

## 📋 PSYCHO-LOGIC CHECKLIST

For each asset, verify:

**Emotional Dimension**:
- [ ] Does it make them FEEL understood (not just inform them)?
- [ ] Does it address their emotional fears (change risk, execution risk)?
- [ ] Does it paint a vivid "after" picture (emotional vision)?
- [ ] Does it build momentum (early wins before big commitment)?

**Logical Dimension**:
- [ ] Does it provide proof (specific examples, not claims)?
- [ ] Does it show methodology (repeatable system, not one-off)?
- [ ] Does it address objections (risk, execution, fit)?
- [ ] Does it lay out next steps (clear path forward)?

**Psychological Signals**:
- [ ] Does it signal intelligence (specificity, depth of research)?
- [ ] Does it signal confidence (not arrogance - admission of mistakes)?
- [ ] Does it signal authority (pattern recognition across multiple wins)?
- [ ] Does it create momentum (halo effect across touchpoints)?

## 🎭 RORY'S KEY INSIGHT FOR JOB HUNTING

> "The problem is that we're not thinking about the irrationality of hiring, we're just presenting facts.
> Facts don't move people. Stories and feelings do. Reality is secondary to perception."

**Applied**: Don't just say "I increased revenue 40%"
Say: "I figured out how to make your best people happier AND richer, at the same time"

One's a statistic. The other's a feeling. Feelings drive hiring decisions.
