## 🧠 CORE PRINCIPLES

### Principle 1: ATS Optimization First
- **Definition**: Use exact keywords from job description to pass automated screening
- **Why**: 75% of resumes never reach human eyes - ATS filters first
- **How**: Extract 10-15 critical keywords from job posting, weave into bullets naturally
- **Example**: If job says "lifecycle marketing," use that exact phrase (not "customer journey marketing")
- **Anti-Pattern**: Using synonyms or paraphrasing critical job terminology
- **Source**: Job-Hunter-OS-Strategic-Guidelines.md (ATS optimization section)

### Principle 2: Reverse Pyramid (Impact → Details)
- **Definition**: Lead with quantified business impact, follow with how you did it
- **Why**: Hiring managers scan top → bottom, must hook them immediately
- **How**: [Result + Metric] first, then [Method/Tactic] second
- **Example**: "Grew revenue $20.5M → $45M (+120% YoY)" BEFORE "by architecting omnichannel marketing OS"
- **Anti-Pattern**: "Responsible for architecting systems that drove growth" (vague, passive)
- **Source**: Reference-Alen-Ascension-Specificity.md

### Principle 3: Match Job's Success Metrics
- **Definition**: Prioritize achievements using THEIR metrics, not just impressive numbers
- **Why**: Shows you understand what they value
- **How**: If job emphasizes "CAC reduction," lead with CAC achievement (even if revenue growth was bigger)
- **Example**: For growth role emphasizing efficiency: "Reduced CAC $500 → $350 (-30%) while scaling acquisition 2x"
- **Anti-Pattern**: Leading with vanity metrics when they care about efficiency
- **Source**: Research brief (Role Analysis section identifies what they value)

### Principle 4: Infrastructure Over Tactics
- **Definition**: Emphasize Matt's "Mechanic" approach - systems built, not just campaigns run
- **Why**: Differentiates from tactical marketers
- **How**: Include 1 bullet focused on infrastructure/automation/scalability
- **Example**: "Architected marketing OS (CRM + automation + dashboards) enabling 7-person team to scale revenue 120% without proportional headcount"
- **Anti-Pattern**: All bullets about running campaigns/initiatives (makes Matt look like executor, not architect)
- **Source**: Matt-Dimock-Professional-Profile.md (Core Genius section)

## ⚙️ TACTICAL RULES

### Rule 1: Bullet Formula
**[Action Verb] [Specific Achievement] → [Quantified Result] ([Business Impact])**

**Acceptable variations:**
- **[Metric-First]**: "Grew revenue $20.5M → $45M (+120% YoY) by architecting..."
- **[Challenge-Solution]**: "Faced 40% CAC spike; rebuilt acquisition funnel reducing CAC 30% within 60 days"
- **[Scale Focus]**: "Scaled paid acquisition $500K → $3M/month while maintaining $400 CAC"

### Rule 2: Quantify Everything
- Revenue: Exact $ or % growth
- Team: Exact headcount
- Budget: Exact $ managed
- Time: Exact timeframe
- Scale: Before → After metrics

If no hard numbers exist, use estimated ranges: "~$2M budget" or "10+ team members"

### Rule 3: Use Job's Exact Terminology
Extract from job description:
- If they say "demand generation," use that (not "lead gen")
- If they say "ARR," use that (not "annual revenue")
- If they say "product-led growth," use that exact phrase
- If they say "mid-market," use that (not "SMB" or "enterprise")

### Rule 4: Prioritize by Relevance
Bullets ranked by job requirement priority:
1. **Must-have skill #1** → Matt's strongest proof point
2. **Must-have skill #2** → Matt's 2nd strongest proof point
3. **Leadership** (if managing team) → Team building achievement
4. **Infrastructure** → Matt's "Mechanic" differentiator
5. **Nice-to-have** → Stretch/bonus achievement

### Rule 5: Length Constraints
- Each bullet: 1-2 lines maximum (100-150 characters)
- Total bullets: 4-6 (no more, no less)
- If role has >5 years scope, aim for 6 bullets
- If role has <3 years scope, aim for 4 bullets
