# 90-Day Plan Prompt (Hero Asset)

> **Reference**: This prompt follows `/docs/Asset-Generation-Template.md` structure.

## 📌 PURPOSE
Generate a hyper-specific 90-day plan that demonstrates Matt has already diagnosed the company's growth problem and knows exactly how to solve it.

**When Used**: After research brief is complete  
**Input**: Research brief + Matt's profile + job description  
**Output**: 800-word phased plan (Diagnosis → Design → Execute → Scale)  
**Success Metric**: Hiring manager says "This person gets it" after reading

## 🧠 CORE PRINCIPLES

### Principle 1: Lead with Diagnosis (Not Solution)
- **Definition**: First 150 words must articulate THEIR specific problem
- **Why**: Shows you understand before prescribing
- **How**: Reference research findings: "Your Series C scaling issue manifests as..."
- **Example**: "Your CAC jumped from $400 to $650 post-Series B while competitors stayed at $350. Root cause: Sales cycle extended from 60 to 120 days due to enterprise expansion without updated enablement."
- **Anti-Pattern**: Jumping straight to "Here's what I'll do"
- **Source**: Design Thinking (Empathize → Define), Job-Hunter-OS-Strategic-Guidelines.md

### Principle 2: Quick Wins Build Momentum
- **Definition**: Days 15-30 must include 1-2 measurable wins
- **Why**: Psychological trust-building (Alen's short-term language)
- **How**: Identify low-hanging fruit from research
- **Example**: "Week 3: Re-engage 500 churned trials with new offer. Expected: 50 conversions = $250K ARR at zero new acquisition cost."
- **Anti-Pattern**: All wins deferred to Month 3
- **Source**: Reference-Alen-Ascension-Specificity.md

### Principle 3: Connect to Matt's Proof Points
- **Definition**: Every major initiative must reference a past win
- **Why**: Credibility through pattern recognition
- **How**: "At [Company], I solved exactly this by..."
- **Example**: "At Prosper, I compressed sales cycle 40% using similar playbook: redesigned demo flow, added ROI calculator, trained sales on value selling. Revenue scaled 120% as result."
- **Anti-Pattern**: Generic claims without proof
- **Source**: Matt-Dimock-Professional-Profile.md

### Principle 4: Quantify Every Initiative
- **Definition**: Every action must have expected business impact
- **Why**: Hormozi Value Equation - clear ROI
- **How**: Use formula: (Expected Outcome - Current State) = Value Added
- **Example**: "CAC reduction from $650 → $450 = $200 savings per customer × 100 customers/month = $240K annual savings"
- **Anti-Pattern**: Vague "improve efficiency"
- **Source**: Reference-Hormozi-Value-Equation.md, Job-Hunter-OS-Strategic-Guidelines.md

## ⚙️ TACTICAL RULES

### Rule 1: Structure is Sacred
Days 1-30 = DIAGNOSE (clarity on problem)  
Days 31-60 = DESIGN (prioritized roadmap)  
Days 61-90 = EXECUTE (pilot + proof)  
Beyond 90 = SCALE (long-term vision)

### Rule 2: Use Their Exact Terminology
If they say "CAC payback," use that (not "customer acquisition")  
If they say "ARR," use that (not "annual revenue")  
Mirror their language = you speak their language

### Rule 3: Front-Load the Problem
150-200 words diagnosing THEIR specific bottleneck before any solution  
This is counterintuitive but critical for credibility

### Rule 4: Weekly Granularity in Month 1
Week 1-2: Exact activities  
Week 3-4: Exact activities  
Month 2: Bi-weekly activities  
Month 3: Monthly milestones

### Rule 5: Acknowledge Risks
Include 3 risks + mitigations  
Shows you've thought this through, not selling fairy tale
