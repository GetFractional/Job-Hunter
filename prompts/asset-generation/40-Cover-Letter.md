## 🧠 CORE PRINCIPLES

### Principle 1: Hook with Insight (Not Enthusiasm)
- **Definition**: Open with specific insight about their business, not generic excitement
- **Why**: Separates you from 99% of applicants who say "I'm excited about..."
- **How**: Reference research finding that shows you understand their inflection point
- **Example**: "Your Series C → public transition is textbook: CAC rising, sales cycle extending, but marketing infrastructure hasn't scaled with enterprise motion."
- **Anti-Pattern**: "I'm excited to apply for this amazing opportunity at your innovative company"
- **Source**: Rory Sutherland Psycho-Logic - specificity builds trust

### Principle 2: Problem Before Solution
- **Definition**: Articulate THEIR problem in detail before offering your solution
- **Why**: Demonstrates empathy and diagnostic thinking (Alen's framework)
- **How**: Spend 100+ words on problem diagnosis, only then introduce solution
- **Example**: First describe their CAC/LTV squeeze, THEN say "I've solved exactly this at Prosper..."
- **Anti-Pattern**: Jumping straight to "Here's what I'd do" without acknowledging their context
- **Source**: Design Thinking (Empathize → Define → Ideate)

### Principle 3: Proof Through Pattern Recognition
- **Definition**: Connect their problem to Matt's past win using "I've solved exactly this" framing
- **Why**: Pattern recognition = credibility (not just capability)
- **How**: "At [Company], I faced similar challenge: [their problem mirror]. Here's how I solved it: [specific tactic + result]"
- **Example**: "At Prosper, CAC spiked 40% during similar expansion. I rebuilt acquisition funnel using [specific approach], reducing CAC 30% within 60 days."
- **Anti-Pattern**: Generic "I have experience in growth marketing" without specific parallel
- **Source**: Matt-Dimock-Professional-Profile.md

### Principle 4: Reference the 90-Day Plan (Without Quoting)
- **Definition**: Paint picture of what Matt would do, informed by 90-day plan
- **Why**: Shows you've already done the thinking (not winging it)
- **How**: Mention 1-2 key initiatives from plan in conversational language
- **Example**: "First 30 days, I'd diagnose your full acquisition funnel to pinpoint where sales cycle is stalling..."
- **Anti-Pattern**: Copy-pasting sections from 90-day plan into letter
- **Source**: 20-90-Day-Plan.md output

## ⚙️ TACTICAL RULES

### Rule 1: Paragraph Structure
**Paragraph 1 (Hook)**: Specific insight about their business (2-3 sentences)  
**Paragraph 2 (Problem)**: Articulate their #1 growth constraint (3-4 sentences)  
**Paragraph 3 (Proof)**: Cite parallel win from Matt's past (3-4 sentences)  
**Paragraph 4 (Solution)**: Preview what Matt would do (3-4 sentences)  
**Paragraph 5 (CTA)**: Clear ask for next step (2 sentences)

### Rule 2: Word Count Discipline
- Total: 300-400 words (strictly enforced)
- If over 400 words, cut fluff (never cut specifics)
- If under 300 words, add more problem diagnosis

### Rule 3: Tone Calibration
- **Authoritative**: "I architected..." (not "I helped...")
- **Specific**: Exact numbers/metrics
- **Confident but humble**: "I've solved this before" + "I'd love to explore if my approach fits"
- **No fluff**: Zero "passionate," "excited," "innovative," "synergy"

### Rule 4: Mirror Their Language
- Use their terminology from job description
- Use their company's stated values/mission (if authentic)
- Match formality level (startup = casual, enterprise = formal)

### Rule 5: Single Focus
- Each letter addresses ONE primary problem
- Don't try to solve all their challenges
- Deep > wide (better to nail one thing than skim three)
