## 🧠 CORE PRINCIPLES

### Principle 1: Hook with Diagnosis (Not Pitch)
- **Definition**: Lead with specific insight about their business, not who you are
- **Why**: Hooks attention immediately, shows you've done homework
- **How**: Reference specific challenge from research in sentence 1
- **Example**: "Your Series C GTM isn't scaling with revenue growth - most teams solve this with headcount, but infrastructure is what's needed."
- **Anti-Pattern**: "Hi, I'm Matt and I applied for your VP Growth role..."
- **Source**: Reference-Rory-Psychologic.md (Lead with insight, not identity)

### Principle 2: Proof Through Pattern Recognition
- **Definition**: Establish credibility via similar past win (not generic experience)
- **Why**: "I've done exactly this before" > "I have 10 years experience"
- **How**: Cite ONE specific achievement that mirrors their challenge
- **Example**: "I've architected the systems that scaled revenue 50-100% in 12 months without proportional headcount."
- **Anti-Pattern**: "I have extensive experience in growth marketing and would love to discuss..."
- **Source**: Reference-Alen-Ascension-Specificity.md

### Principle 3: Create Scarcity Without Desperation
- **Definition**: Signal time constraint to create urgency (but stay confident)
- **Why**: Scarcity increases perceived value (Hormozi)
- **How**: Mention you're "evaluating a few opportunities" or have "decision timeline"
- **Example**: "I'm evaluating 2-3 opportunities this month - up for a conversation?"
- **Anti-Pattern**: "I'm very interested and hoping to hear back soon!" (sounds desperate)
- **Source**: Reference-Hormozi-Value-Equation.md (Scarcity as value multiplier)

### Principle 4: Question Not Statement
- **Definition**: End with question that invites response (not period)
- **Why**: Questions have 2x response rate vs. statements
- **How**: "Up for a conversation?" or "Interested in exploring this?"
- **Example**: "Worth a 20-minute conversation?" (not "I'd love to chat.")
- **Anti-Pattern**: "Looking forward to hearing from you." (closed statement)
- **Source**: Direct response marketing principles

## ⚙️ TACTICAL RULES

### Rule 1: Three-Sentence Structure
**Sentence 1 (Hook):** Specific insight about their business challenge  
**Sentence 2 (Proof):** Your credibility via parallel past win  
**Sentence 3 (CTA):** Question inviting response + light scarcity  

### Rule 2: Word Count Discipline
- Total: 40-60 words (strictly)
- If over 60 words, you're being too wordy
- If under 40 words, you're missing critical elements

### Rule 3: Timing Strategy
Send 3-5 days after application:
- Too soon (<3 days): Seems desperate
- Too late (>7 days): They've moved on
- Sweet spot: 3-5 days (shows thoughtfulness + urgency)

### Rule 4: Channel Selection
**Email** (preferred):
- Subject: "VP Growth @ [Company] - Quick thought on GTM scaling"
- Send to hiring manager if you can find their email
- CC recruiter if you must

**LinkedIn DM** (backup):
- Use if you can't find email
- Same message structure
- Connection request + message simultaneously

### Rule 5: Subject Line Formula (Email Only)
**[ROLE TITLE] @ [COMPANY] - [Specific Topic]**

Examples:
- "VP Growth @ TechCorp - Quick thought on CAC scaling"
- "Director RevOps @ SaasCo - Series B → C transition"
- "Head of Lifecycle @ FinTech - PLG → Sales-led motion"

---

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Series B → C Scaling Challenge
**Subject:** VP Growth @ TechCorp - Series B → C GTM scaling

Your Series C GTM isn't scaling with revenue growth - most teams solve this with headcount, but infrastructure is what's needed. I've architected the systems that scaled revenue 50-100% in 12 months without proportional headcount, and I'd bring that exact playbook to you. I'm evaluating 2-3 opportunities this month - up for a conversation?

Best,  
Matt

---

### Example 2: CAC Efficiency Problem
**Subject:** Director Demand Gen @ SaasCo - CAC reduction strategy

Your CAC jumped 40% post-Series B while competitors stayed flat - classic scaling problem. At Prosper, I reduced CAC 30% in 8 weeks using infrastructure over headcount approach (revenue scaled 120% in same period). Worth a 20-minute conversation this week?

Best,  
Matt

---

### Example 3: PLG → Sales-Led Transition
**Subject:** VP Lifecycle @ FinTech - PLG to sales-led motion

Transitioning PLG → sales-led without breaking what works is tricky - most companies overcorrect and lose self-serve momentum. I've built the hybrid infrastructure that preserved 70% self-serve while scaling enterprise 3x at similar-stage company. Interested in exploring how I'd approach yours?

Best,  
Matt
