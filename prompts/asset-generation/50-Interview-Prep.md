## 🧠 CORE PRINCIPLES

### Principle 1: STAR Stories Must Mirror Their Challenges
- **Definition**: Select stories that directly parallel THEIR current problems
- **Why**: Shows pattern recognition, not just capability
- **How**: Map research findings → Matt's past wins with similar context
- **Example**: If they're struggling with CAC, tell story about Prosper CAC reduction (not random revenue win)
- **Anti-Pattern**: Telling your "greatest hit" that's irrelevant to their situation
- **Source**: Job-Hunter-OS-Strategic-Guidelines.md (Pattern Recognition section)

### Principle 2: Objections Are Buying Signals
- **Definition**: Pre-empt likely objections and reframe them as assets
- **Why**: Shows self-awareness and addresses elephant in room
- **How**: Identify 3 likely concerns, prepare honest + confident responses
- **Example**: "You haven't been in role long" → "Correct - I move fast, learn quickly, and deliver results in months not years"
- **Anti-Pattern**: Getting defensive or apologizing for gaps
- **Source**: Reference-Rory-Psychologic.md (Reframing)

### Principle 3: Questions Reveal Strategic Thinking
- **Definition**: Your questions matter as much as your answers
- **Why**: Questions show what you prioritize and how you think
- **How**: Ask about their constraints, not just their goals
- **Example**: "What's the #1 growth constraint keeping your CEO up at night?" (not "What's the culture like?")
- **Anti-Pattern**: Generic questions you could ask any company
- **Source**: Research brief (Strategic Positioning section)

### Principle 4: Specificity Builds Credibility
- **Definition**: Every story must have exact metrics and timeframes
- **Why**: Vague stories sound fabricated, specific stories sound true
- **How**: Use Alen's framework - drill down to "how specifically?"
- **Example**: "Reduced CAC from $650 to $420 (-35%) over 8 weeks" (not "significantly improved efficiency")
- **Anti-Pattern**: "We saw great results" or "things improved a lot"
- **Source**: Reference-Alen-Ascension-Specificity.md

## ⚙️ TACTICAL RULES

### Rule 1: STAR Story Structure
**Situation** (30 sec): Company context, market, team, problem  
**Task** (20 sec): Your specific role/responsibility  
**Action** (60 sec): Exact steps YOU took (emphasize "I" not "we")  
**Result** (30 sec): Quantified outcome + business impact  

Total: 2-3 minutes per story

### Rule 2: Story Selection Criteria
- **Story 1**: Mirrors their #1 challenge (from research)
- **Story 2**: Shows leadership/team building (if managing team)
- **Story 3**: Shows Matt's "Mechanic" approach (infrastructure/systems)

### Rule 3: Objection Response Framework
**Acknowledge** → **Reframe** → **Prove**

Example:
- Acknowledge: "You're right, I've only been in this role 18 months"
- Reframe: "That's because I deliver results quickly - I don't need 3 years to make impact"
- Prove: "At Prosper, I scaled revenue 120% in 18 months, faster than my predecessor did in 3 years"

### Rule 4: Question Types to Prepare
- **1-2 Strategic** (CEO-level concerns)
- **1-2 Tactical** (Your role's day-to-day)
- **1 Risk** (What could go wrong? How are you thinking about it?)

### Rule 5: Interview Close Technique
After answering their questions, ask:
"Based on our conversation, do you have any concerns about my fit for this role?"
→ Surfaces hidden objections you can address immediately
