## 🧠 CORE PRINCIPLES

### Principle 1: Specificity Over Surface-Level Research
- **Definition**: Find details ONLY true of THIS company (not "companies like this")
- **Why It Matters**: Generic research → generic assets → no competitive advantage
- **How To Apply**: Use Alen's Specificity framework - dig until you find unique signals
- **Example**: 
  - ❌ "Series B SaaS company focused on growth"
  - ✅ "Series B SaaS ($45M raised, Sequoia lead) expanding from SMB to enterprise (50+ employee customers now 30% of ARR), hiring first demand gen leader because founder-led marketing can't scale"
- **Anti-Pattern**: Stopping at Crunchbase surface data
- **Source**: Reference-Alen-Ascension-Specificity.md

### Principle 2: Diagnose Their Inflection Point
- **Definition**: Identify the specific growth constraint they're facing RIGHT NOW
- **Why It Matters**: The 90-day plan must solve their current problem, not a generic one
- **How To Apply**: Look for signals: funding round + hiring spike = scaling challenge; layoffs + restructure = efficiency focus
- **Example**: "They raised $30M in Q2 but revenue grew only 20% (below SaaS median 40%). Likely issue: CAC too high or sales cycle too long. Hiring a VP Growth signals they know it."
- **Anti-Pattern**: Describing what they do, not what problem they face
- **Source**: Job-Hunter-OS-Strategic-Guidelines.md (Design Thinking)

### Principle 3: Competitive Positioning Context
- **Definition**: Understand where they sit vs. competitors (feature parity, pricing, market share)
- **Why It Matters**: Influences what growth strategy will work
- **How To Apply**: Porter's Five Forces - who are they really competing with? What's their differentiation?
- **Example**: "Competing with HubSpot (800lb gorilla) and Marketo (enterprise), but positioning as 'easier than Marketo, more powerful than HubSpot' for mid-market. That's a tough middle position - neither cheapest nor most feature-rich."
- **Anti-Pattern**: Not researching competitors at all
- **Source**: Job-Hunter-OS-Strategic-Guidelines.md (Porter's Five Forces)

### Principle 4: Hiring Manager Context (If Available)
- **Definition**: Research the hiring manager's background, priorities, decision style
- **Why It Matters**: Informs tone, level of detail, what to emphasize in cover letter
- **How To Apply**: LinkedIn profile - what's their background? Technical or commercial? Recent posts - what are they focused on?
- **Example**: "Hiring manager is CRO with 3 years at company, ex-Salesforce. Posts frequently about sales enablement, pipeline velocity. Likely values: speed, execution, sales-marketing alignment."
- **Anti-Pattern**: Ignoring the person who'll interview you
- **Source**: Design Thinking (Empathize phase)

## ⚙️ TACTICAL RULES

### Rule 1: Use Primary Sources
- Prioritize: Company blog, press releases, CEO LinkedIn, earnings calls (if public)
- Avoid: Generic "company review" sites, old news
- Formula: 70% primary sources, 30% secondary analysis

### Rule 2: Time-Box Research
- 5-10 minutes max for initial research
- If you can't find key data in 10 minutes, note what's missing and move forward
- Don't let perfect research block asset generation

### Rule 3: Structure Around Their Problem
- Don't just describe the company
- Diagnose: What growth problem are they trying to solve by hiring this role?
- Formula: Current State → Problem Hypothesis → Evidence → Implication for Role

### Rule 4: Calculate unit economics (CAC/LTV - mandatory attempt)
- Check it the company discloses CAC or LTV explicitly in earnings, investor decks, or blog posts, If yes, quote the numbers with source and year.
- If not disclosed, estimate a rnage instead of a single point using:
  - Revenue, orders, and active customers (to get AOV and rough LTV).
  - Any disclosed or typical marketing spend % of revenue for that vertical.
  - Reputable CAC benchmarks for the industry (e.g., ecommerce overall, health/wellness, supplements).
- Clearly label outputs as either:
  - reported_cac: “Company-reported CAC: $X (Year, Source)”
  - estimated_cac_range: “Estimated CAC: $A–$B based on assumptions (list them).”
- In market_summary and/or key_insights, and when not disclosed by the company, always use patterns like:
  - “Estimated CAC: $30–80 per customer globally (based on XYZ assumptions; not company-reported).”
  - “US CAC likely: $60–150+ initially given competitive intensity and low brand awareness.”

### Rule 5: Don't make up information or data
- You may not invent or interpolate percentage improvements that are not explicitly in the profile. If a % lift or reduction is not stated, do not fabricate it. If you model a hypothetical scenario (e.g., CAC reduction), label it as ‘estimated’ and explain the assumptions.
